# Diabetes Risk Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the risk of diabetes by collecting and analyzing data from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. 

## Approach:

- **Data Collection:** Data was collected from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to build the predictive model.
  
- **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering:** Rigorous data cleaning and feature engineering processes were conducted to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- **Oversampling Techniques:** Oversampling techniques, specifically SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), were incorporated to address class imbalance in the dataset.

- **Model Implementation:** Various machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision tree, Gaussian Naive Bayes, AdaBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbors, were implemented to predict the risk of diabetes.

## Results:

- Achieved a notable accuracy of 80% in predicting the risk of diabetes.
